# Python Enigma Simulator

A Python-based simulator of the WWII German Enigma machine, demonstrating its basic encryption and decryption process.

*This file is in English. For the Turkish version, please see [README.tr.md](README.tr.md).*

## Description

This project is an educational tool that simulates the fundamental workings of the Enigma machine. It implements rotors, a reflector, plugboard configurations, and stepping mechanisms to show how messages were encrypted and decrypted.

## Features

- Rotor-based substitution cipher
- Reflector that sends the signal back through the rotors
- Plugboard (fiş tahtası) to swap pairs of letters
- Historical rotor and reflector permutations

## Usage

- Adjust the rotors, plugboard, and reflector settings in the code.
- Run the Python script to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- To decrypt an encrypted message, use the same machine settings.
